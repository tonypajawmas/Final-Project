          San Jose is home to some of the most authentic Mexican cuisine found
          north of the border. Tony was inspired by his love of traditional
          regional food to create

          The cuisine captures the authentic spirit of Mexico, starting with a
          few classic recipes culled from Tony's family and friends. Tony's has
          quickly become a San Jose staple for locals and visitors alike over,
